# CutBox 1.6.0

## New Features

### Additional Language Support

CutBox is now available in more languages for an enhanced user experience:

- 嗨 (Simplified Chinese)
- やあ (Japanese)
- วัสดี (Thai)
-  (Korean)
- Hallo (Deutsch)
- Hola (Español)
- Bonjour (Français) 

### Time Filter Keyboard Control

We've introduced a convenient keyboard shortcut for the time filter:

- Use <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> to toggle the time filter text field on/off.
- When toggled on, the text cursor automatically moves to enter the time filter.
- While entering the time filter, pressing <kbd>RET</kbd> will return the text cursor to the search text field.

### CutBox History Migration

We've ensured that all items in your history can now be time filtered:

- CutBox history from versions ≤ 1.6.0 migrated to add time stamps to any items which didn't have them (Created by ≤ v1.5.5).
- Please note that legacy items saved by CutBox ≤ 1.5.5 will be time-stamped to 30 days before the current date.
